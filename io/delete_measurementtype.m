function [varargout] = delete_measurementtype(conn, paramname,sensor,station)

%DELETE_MEASUREMENTTYPE this function is used for removing the measurement
%                       type associated to a sensor.
%
%   Input:
%   conn: Database connection which must have been previously created.
%   paramname: Name of the measurement type.
%   sensor: ID of the sensor which is associated with the
%             measurement type.
%	station: station where is the measurement type.
%
%   Output:
%   varargout: The output argument might or might not be present, if it
%   is, means the status of the transaction. 0 if the deletion was
%   successful, 1 otherwise.
%
%   Example:
%   status  = delete_measurementtype(conn,'tide','sensor_tide','CARTAGENA')
%
